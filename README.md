# Boston Police Department (BPD) Budget & Payroll Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Boston Police Department (BPD) budget and payroll data (2024)** to understand:  
- Year-over-year changes in the BPD budget.  
- Shifts in funding across departments.  
- Officer pay trends (regular vs overtime vs injury pay).  
- Comparison of BPD pay with other Boston city employees.  
- Overtime trends and forecasting for the upcoming year.  

 **Extension Goals (if time permits):**  
- Predict future overtime costs using ML models.  
- Detect anomalies in officer pay patterns.  
- Explore clustering of officers based on pay/(Overtime)OT behavior.  
- Investigate systemic trends or inequalities.
- Build classification models to predict which officers are likely to become “high overtime earners” in future years.
